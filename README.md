# Fitness Chatbot App — Thesis Project 💪🧠

This repository contains the full-stack codebase for my Master's thesis in Applied Informatics – AI Track (KU Leuven).  
It consists of:

- **Frontend:** A [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev), providing users with an engaging, conversational interface for tracking and understanding their fitness data.
- **Backend:** A [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) server (Python), which powers the chatbot, provides personalized insights, and serves fitness data from a database and CSV files.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### ▶️ 1. Frontend (Expo React Native App)

```sh
cd Frontend/FitnessCoach
npm install
npx expo start
```

Use Expo Go on your mobile device, or an Android/iOS emulator, to view the app.
Edit code in the app directory—this project uses file-based routing.

### ▶️ 2. Backend (FastAPI Python Server)

```sh
cd Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Requires Python 3.10+.
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
The .env file (not committed to git) should contain any sensitive settings.

### Backend Overview
- main.py: Entry point; starts the FastAPI application.
- data_endpoints.py: API endpoints to serve fitness data.
- chatbot_endpoints_sql.py: Endpoints for chatbot logic and LLM integration.
- database.py: Handles connection to the SQLite database.
- data/: Directory containing used fitness tracker CSVs and associated .db file.
- click_logs/: Logs user interactions for analysis.
- .env: Environment variables (OPEN_API_KEY).

### Front-end Project Structure
The most important parts of the front-end are highlighted in the following structure:
```
/fitnesscoach
 ├── /app - Main application logic
 │   ├── /auth - Authentication flow
 │      ⚠️ This folder is currently **not used in the current version** of the app. (Placeholder for future)
 │   ├── /tabs - Contains main screens - (these folders contain different files)
 │   │   ├── /chat - Handles chat-related functionality: chat page and browsing earlier conversations
 │   │   ├── /dashboard - Displays fitness data and statistics, ranging from an overall dashboard to detailed ones
 │   │   ├── /home - Entry screen of the application
 │   │   ├── /profile - Manages user profile settings
 │   │   ├── /progress - Tracks and manages fitness goals, overview and edit screens
 │   ├── /context - Handles switching between multiple user profiles and managing of the active one
 ├── /assets - Contains images, icons, and other static files
 ├── /components - Reusable UI components
 ├── /constants - Global constants
 ├── app.json - Expo configuration
 ├── config.js - General configuration
```

### Key Dependencies
This project requires the following **non-standard** packages (front-end):

| Package                           | Description |
|-----------------------------------|------------|
| `react-native-markdown-display`   | Renders markdown in chat bubbles. |
| `expo`                            | Framework for React Native apps. |
| `react-native-gesture-handler`    | Handles gestures in Expo. |
| `react-native-reanimated`         | Enables smooth animations. |
| `react-native-svg`                | Provides SVG support for graphical elements. |
| `victory-native`                  | Enables data visualization and charts. |
| `react-native-toast-message`      | Displays toast notifications in the app. |
| `nativewind`                      | Tailwind CSS styling for React Native. |

To install all dependencies, run:
```sh
npm install
```
Or, if using **Yarn**:
```sh
yarn install
```

### Backend (FastAPI)
- fastapi, uvicorn
- pydantic
- sqlite3 (standard library)
- pandas (for CSV/data handling)
- python-dotenv (for .env config)

Install dependencies with:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🛠️ Usage & Development Tips
- Change API base URL: If you change backend port or deploy to another server, update config.js in Frontend/FitnessCoach/.
- Testing backend endpoints: Use a tool like http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI auto-generated by FastAPI).
- User data: Uses pre-existing fitness tracker data (CSV/database); no live device integration.
- Click logs: User interactions with the app are logged in Backend/click_logs/ for research/analysis.

---

### Features
- Conversational Chatbot: Users can ask questions about their fitness data (steps, sleep, heart rate, goals, etc.) and get actionable insights.
- Personalized Recommendations: Backend processes user data to provide advice and visualizations.
- Rich UI: Custom ChatBubble component, markdown rendering, charts with victory-native.
- User Feedback: Toast notifications for actions and responses.

---

### Layout and UI Details
- Modular Layouts: _layout.tsx files organize navigation and shared UI per section.
- Reusable Components: Designed for maintainability and scalability.
